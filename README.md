# 💸 Cashkey - Visualize your cash flow

Cashkey is a web application that helps users visualize their annual cash flow with a Sankey diagram. The app makes it easy to track income sources and expenses, see the balance, and share the visualization with others.

Modified by [Redis Kostalli](https://cored.al) for VAT (20%) support on income and automatic VAT calculation as expense, for small businesses and freelancers in Albania.
## Why

- Money is like water. It flows in and out of our lives.
- Many people don’t know how their money comes and goes.
- Sankey diagrams are great for visualizing things that flow. 
- Sankey diagrams are not a chart type offered natively in spreadsheet apps. Sankey makers (like the awesome [Sankeymatic](https://sankeymatic.com/build/)) still require markup and math that's easy to botch.
- Cashkey builds a Sankey diagram your cash flow quickly and easily and keeps it private-no data gets sent to a server or stored in a database, it's all in the URL you can choose to bookmark or share.

## Features

- Interactive Sankey diagram showing income and expense flows
- Displays each income and expense as a percentage of the total
- Shows budget surplus or deficit
- Add multiple income sources and expenses
- Enter amounts as either monthly or annual values
- Responsive design works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- All data is stored in the URL for easy sharing and privacy
- No server-side processing or storage of user data
